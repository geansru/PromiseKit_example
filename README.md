# PromiseKit example

Asynchronous programming can be a real pain in the lemon. Unless you’re extremely careful, it can easily result in humongous delegates, messy completion handlers and long nights debugging code! But there’s a better way: promises. Promises tame asynchronicity by letting you write code as a series of actions based on events. This works especially well for actions that must occur in a certain order.
